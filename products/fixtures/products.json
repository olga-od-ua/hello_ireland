It is not known when exactly the house was constructed, but it is clearly indicated on the Ordnance Survey map published in 1841 along with three other houses which formed a cluster around the church and national school. There are now no visible remains of the other houses or the school. The first known inhabitants of our house were Patrick and Mary Redmond – the great, great, great grandparents of our children – who took up residence in the 1860s and were both teachers in the national school. On their retirement, their daughter Margaret Redmond took over as teacher and remained living in the cottage until she died in 1974. The restoration of the house was assisted by grants from the Heritage Council and Wexford County Council through the Built Heritage Jobs Leverage Scheme 2014 and is now home of the heirs of the original owners.", "price": 58.99, "category": 1, "rating": 4.6, "image_url": "https://res.cloudinary.com/djaujigfg/image/upload/v1637853023/ireland_images/buildings/thatched_house_ballygarran_vk6joo.jpg", "image": "thatched_house_ballygarran.jpeg"}}]
